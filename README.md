# Sentiment Analysis

**In this project, we mainly focused on the sentiment analysis.**

## Introduction

We trained 2 models to classify tweets (**is news** or **not news**): [logistic regression model](https://github.com/shuxg2017/NLP-sentiment-analysis-classification/blob/master/bow_logreg.ipynb) and [lstm model](https://github.com/shuxg2017/NLP-sentiment-analysis-classification/blob/master/embedding%20and%20lstm.ipynb)

**The goal is to visualize the concept space, and give you guys intuition that complex models work in the same way as simple models**
